#summary Installation Instructions.

= Installation =
Two installation methods are available depending on how you want to use Bites

== Market Releases ==
If you just want it to work then this is the method for you. Bites can be installed through the android application market place by clicking "market" on your phone.

== Testing Release ==
This is for those interested in testing new features and finding bugs before a new version is released to the general public through the market. This is still a signed app, but you will need to tick the option to allow installation of non-market applications on your phone. This is under Menu/Settings/Applications/Unknown sources. Once you have done this you can scan the QR code below with _zxing_ to install, or use your phone browser to navigate to the Downloads tab on this page and click on the testing release download. Personally I find the scanner option much quicker.
